Tips for using Z:/sqlite.bat

SQL is made up of two parts:
   DDL: Data Definition Language
   	- define structure of the data
   	- creating tables and saying what goes in them

   DML: Data Manipulation Language
    - inserting, removing, updating data in tables
    - SELECT statements to query data


Each table has a "schema" that defines its structure.
   What columns does the table have?
   
   What type of data is stored in each column?
      - is it Text? Numbers? Etc.

   Are there any other constraints on the data?
      * must not be null?
      * must be unique (like a movie's ID)?
      * must match a column in some other table?
         example: actor id appears in the actors table AND in the roles table

PRIMARY KEY: a value/column that must be unique within a certain table

FOREIGN KEY: a value/column that refers to a primary key from a different table

Example of a schema:
   CREATE TABLE Planet (
      PlanetID INTEGER,
      Name TEXT,
      Coordinates REAL
   );

Or better yet:
   CREATE TABLE Planet (
      PlanetID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
      Name TEXT NOT NULL,
      Coordinates REAL NOT NULL
   );
