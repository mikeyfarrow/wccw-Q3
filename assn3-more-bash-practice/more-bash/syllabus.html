		<h2>Course Content and Learning Objectives:</h2>

		<p>
			This course is an introduction to programming for the World Wide Web.  You will learn about topics such as:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) for authoring web pages</li>
			<li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for supplying stylistic information to web pages</li>
			<li>JavaScript for creating interactive web pages</li>
			<li>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) for enhanced web interaction and applications</li>
			<li>PHP Hypertext Processor for generating dynamic pages on a web server</li>
			<li>Structured Query Language (SQL) for interacting with databases</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Lecture Times:</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>MWF 3:30pm - 4:20pm, GUG 220</li>
			<li>Th 8:30am - 12:20pm, MGH 334 (lab sessions, 50 minutes each)</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Textbooks and Readings:</h2>

		<p>
			We will be using an online textbook-in-progress written by Marty Stepp and Jessica Miller.  No problems or assignments will be assigned directly out of this textbook, and no fee must be paid to use it.
		</p>


		<h2>Course Web Site:</h2>

		<p>
			<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/190m/">http://www.cs.washington.edu/190m/</a>
		</p>


		<h2>Lab Sessions:</h2>

		<p>
			Every Thursday you will attend a session held in the Introductory Programming Lab (IPL) in rooms 334 and 342 of Mary Gates Hall.  TAs will lead the lab session and help students solve problems.  Participating in your weekly lab session is an important part of the course and will form part of your course grade.  Your lowest two (2) lab session scores will be dropped, allowing you to miss two sessions without penalty.  It will not be possible to make up missed lab sessions without severely extenuating circumstances and the instructor's advance permission.
		</p>

		<p>
			The recommended software for the course is the <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">Mozilla Firefox</a> web browser (with recommended <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> add-on), and the <a href="http://www.textpad.com/">TextPad</a> (Windows) or <a href="http://smultron.sourceforge.net/">Smultron</a> (Mac) text editor.  The course web site contains links to download this software if you want to work at home.
		</p>


		<h2>Grading:</h2>

		<p>
			Graded work will receive categorized point values, with the following categories and their respective weights:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>50% individual homework assignments</li>
			<li>10% lab session participation</li>
			<li>20% midterm exam: <strong>Friday, May 9, 2008, in lecture</strong></li>
			<li>20% final exam: <strong>Thursday, June 12, 2008, 2:30pm - 4:20pm, GUG 220</strong> (tentative date; check web site)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Your percentage is mapped onto the 4.0 grade scale roughly as follows.  You are guaranteed at least the grade shown below for the percentage shown.
		</p>

		<table style="margin: auto">
			<tr>
				<td class="grades">90%: at least 3.5</td>
				<td class="grades">85%: at least 3.0</td>
				<td class="grades">80%: at least 2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="grades">75%: at least 2.0</td>
				<td class="grades">70%: at least 1.5</td>
				<td class="grades">60%: at least 0.7</td>
			</tr>
		</table>


		<h2>Turn-in and Lateness Policy:</h2>

		<p>
			Assignments will have due dates and times written clearly on their specification sheets.  Programming assignments are submitted electronically, usually before midnight on their due date.
		</p>

		<p>
			Programming assignments must be turned in using an online submission system.  The URL for this system can be found on the course web site, in the Homework section.  Assignments will not be accepted by email, FTP, instant message, or other various turn-in methods unless prior permission has been given by the instructor or TA.  It is your responsibility to ensure that your turn-in is completed successfully and on time.
		</p>

		<p>
			Each student receives <strong>5 free "late days"</strong> for use on homework assignments.  A late day allows you to submit a program up to 24 hours late without penalty.  For example, you could use 2 late days and submit a program due Wednesday on Friday with no penalty.  Once a student has used up all late days, each successive day that an assignment is late will result in a loss of 1 point on that assignment.  Regardless of how many late days you have, you may not submit a program more than <strong>3 days</strong> after it is due or after the last day of class.
		</p>

		<p>
			Each student can also receive <strong>"early days"</strong> for submitting an assignment early.  Each increment of 24 hours before the due date that a student turns in an assignment, an &quot;early day&quot; will be awarded.  Up to two (2) days can be earned for a given assignment.  Every time a student earns three (3) early days, the student will be given an extra free &quot;late day.&quot;  This policy is to encourage students to complete homework early and to provide greater flexibility.
		</p>

		<p>
			Students will not be granted extensions for assignments unless they have highly extenuating circumstances as decided by the instructor.
		</p>


		<h2>Exams:</h2>

		<p>
			Exams in this course are open-book and open-notes:  you may use your textbook, handouts, printed solutions to your assignments, or any other written materials.  No computing devices or other students' work or ideas may be used.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you cannot attend lecture on the day of an exam, you must notify the instructor at least 48 hours in advance of the time of the exam, and you must have a valid excuse for missing the lecture.  Make-up exams will not be given without permission from the instructor.
		</p>


		<h2>Collaboration Policy:</h2>

		<p>
			Programming assignments must be completed individually. You may discuss an assignment in general terms with other students, including a general discussion of how to approach the problem, but all code you submit must be your own. Any help you receive from classmates should be limited and should never involve details of how to code a solution. You must abide by the following:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>You may not work as a partner with another student on an assignment.</li>
			<li>You may not show another student your solution to an assignment, nor look at his/her solution.</li>
			<li>You may not have another person &quot;walk you through&quot; an assignment, describe in detail how to solve it, or sit with you as you write it.  You also may not provide such help to another student.  This includes current or former students, tutors, friends, TAs, web site forums, or anyone else.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Under our policy, a student who gives inappropriate help is equally guilty with one who receives it.  Instead of providing such help to someone who does not understand an assignment, point them to other class resources such as lecture examples, the textbook, the IPL, or emailing a TA or instructor.  You must not share your solution code and ideas with others.  You must also take reasonable steps to ensure that your work is not copied by others, such as by making sure to log out or lock shared computers, not leaving printouts of your code in public places, and not emailing your code to other students or posting it on the web or public forums.
		</p>

		<p>
			We enforce this policy by running similarity detection software a few times per quarter over all submitted student programs, including programs from past quarters.  Students who violate the policy are given reduced scores and sometimes sent to a University committee.  This can lead to marks on permanent academic records.  Please contact the instructor if you are unsure whether a particular behavior falls within our policy.
