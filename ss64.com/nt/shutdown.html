<p>Shutdown the computer</p>
<pre>Syntax
      SHUTDOWN [<i>logoff_option</i>]  [/m \\<i>Computer</i>] [<i>options</i>]

logoff_options:
    /i         Display the GUI (must be the first option)
    /l         Log off. This cannot be used with /m or /d option.
    /s         Shutdown.
    /r         Shutdown and Restart.
    /g         Shutdown and Restart, after restarting restart any registered applications.
    /a         Abort a system shutdown during the time-out period.
    /p         Turn off the local computer with no time-out or warning
               (only with /d)
    /h         Hibernate the local computer (can be used with /f )
    /e         Document the reason for an unexpected shutdown of a computer.

Options:<br>
   /m \\<i>Computer</i>  A remote computer to shutdown.

   /t <i>xxx</i>         Time until system shutdown in seconds. 
                  The valid range is xxx=0-<b>600</b> seconds. [default=30]

   /c "<i>Msg</i>"       An optional shutdown message [Max 127 chars]

   /f             Force running applications to close.
                  This will not prompt for File-Save in any open applications.
                  so will result in a loss of any unsaved data.

   /d u:<i>xx:yy</i>     List a USER (unplanned) reason code for the shutdown. 
   /d P:<i>xx:yy</i>     List a PLANNED reason code for the shutdown.
                    <i>xx</i> = The Major reason code (0-255)
                    <i>yy</i> = The Minor reason code (0-65536)
</pre>
<p>In Windows 7, the maximum <span class="code">/t</span> timeout increased from 600 seconds to 315,360,000 seconds (10 years)<br>
If you need to FORCE a shutdown, or target multiple computers at once; use <a href="psshutdown.html">PsShutdown</a> instead. </p>
<h2> Alert Messages to logged in users
</h2>
<p>Shutdown will display one or two alert messages to the user depending on the delay (set with <span class="code">/t</span>) as follows:</p>
<p><span class="code">Delay<br>
&lt; 3 minutes</span> - A custom popup alert appears immediately (default).<br>
<span class="code">&gt;=3 mins and &lt;=10 mins</span> - 
A custom popup alert  immediately and then a generic popup alert<b> 2 mins</b> before shutdown.<br>
<span class="code">&gt; 10 mins and &lt; 11 mins</span> -  A  system tray alert (with custom message) appears immediately, and then nothing else.<br>
<span class="code">&gt;=11 mins </span>- A  system tray alert (with custom message) appears immediately, and then a generic popup alert <b>10 mins</b> before shutdown.</p>
<p> System Tray alerts can be disabled/hidden by the user.<br>
Also, if the computer goes to sleep (due to Power management) before the shutdown actually occurs, then the countdown will resume after the machine is re-awakened - so the delay is running time not clock time. <br>
For these reasons, setting a delay longer than 10 minutes (600 seconds) is not recommended.</p>
<p>If the computer is manually restarted before the schedule set with Shutdown.exe, the scheduled shutdown will be  aborted.</p>
<p>If two shutdown commands are issued against the same computer,  the first command will run and the second will fail with errorlevel 1190. If you need to make a change, abort the first command with <span class="code">shutdown /a</span></p>
<h2>Event Log</h2>
<p>Shutdown.exe will record events in the Windows SYSTEM Event log with a Source=User32</p>
<ul>
<li>When a Shutdown command is issued with a timeout of &gt; 120 seconds, event ID 1074 is logged.</li>
<li> Just before the computer is shutdown, event ID 1074  is logged along with any custom message &amp; reason code.</li>
</ul>
<p>The event log is the only way to tell that a reboot triggered from Shutdown.exe is pending. It also records the username and date/time when the shutdown command was issued.</p>
<p>When using Shutdown.exe to reboot a server, the shutdown process will normally allow  30 seconds to ensure each running service has time to stop. Services are shutdown in alphabetical order. Halting the services manually in  a specific order with <a href="net-service.html">NET STOP</a> or <a href="sc.html">SC</a> can be slightly faster.</p>
<h2>   Reason codes</h2>
<p>  E = Expected<br>
  &nbsp;U = Unexpected <span class="code">0x00000000</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P = Planned<span class="code"> 0x80000000</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C = customer defined <span class="code">0x40000000</span></p>

<p>The reason codes logged in the event log are standard Windows <a href="../external.html?link=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376885.aspx">System Shutdown Reason Codes</a> (in Hex)</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p> Shutdown the local system immediately:<br>
<br>
<span class="code">SHUTDOWN.exe /s /f</span><br>
<br>
Restart the local system in 60 seconds time and specify the reason &quot;Application: Installation (Planned)&quot; : </p>
<p class="code"> SHUTDOWN.exe /r /f /t 60  /d P:4:2</p>
<p>Restart the  remote system <span class="code">server64</span> and specify the reason &quot;Security Fix, Planned&quot; </p>
<p class="code">SHUTDOWN.exe /r /f /m \\server64 /d P:2:17</p>
<p>Using PowerShell, remotely restart a list of computers from a text file of computer names.</p>
